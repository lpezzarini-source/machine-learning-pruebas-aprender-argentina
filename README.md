# Machine Learning Analysis of School Performance in Argentina (Aprender)

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Master’s thesis for the **MSc in Data Science at Universidad de San Andrés**.

The project applies **machine learning techniques** (Random Forest and XGBoost) to analyze the determinants of school performance in Argentina using data from the **National Aprender Assessment (2023)**. The main outcome variable is the percentage of students per school achieving satisfactory or advanced performance in Language and Mathematics.

To enhance interpretability, the analysis relies on **SHAP values**, allowing the identification and decomposition of the contribution of more than 120 predictors across five broad dimensions:
- Household factors  
- Individual factors  
- School trajectory factors  
- Institutional factors  
- Contextual factors
